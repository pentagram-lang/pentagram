prompt = """
Skeptically evaluate the current context (code, files, and recent changes) against the project's coding standards as defined in AGENTS.md.

The command has two modes:
1. **Clear Context**: If the context (specific changes, files, or narrative) is already established in the session, proceed directly to identifying any deviations from these standards.
2. **Unclear Context**: If the context is not clear, **STOP**. Do not run any tools. Ask the user for the context or narrative you should be evaluating.

For complex investigations or to understand wider impacts, you should consider delegating to the `codebase_investigator`.
